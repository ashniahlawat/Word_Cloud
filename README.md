# Word_Cloud_Python 
This code takes up the text of a file on the computer an generates a word cloud for the same. The sizes of the words in the cloud are determined by how many times each word appears in the specific text.
The script processes the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain allalphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.
